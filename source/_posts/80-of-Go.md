> Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its **concurrency mechanisms** make it easy to write programs that **get the most out of multicore and networked machines**, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of **garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection**. It's a **fast, statically typed, compiled** language that **feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language**.
